# Introduction 
The intention of this document is to analyse and to evaluate current options and scenarios for blockchain analytics. 
Practical scenario for this evaluation was the requirement of the YAM DAO to support the [degenerative.finance]( https://degenerative.finance /) subproject with a dashboard that contains specific measures for measuring the development of the project. 
For developing the dashboard, three scenarios and technologies were briefly evaluated: 

* [The Graph]( https://thegraph.com/)
* [Google BigQuery Ethereum dataset](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/ethereum-bigquery-public-dataset-smart-contract-analytics)
* [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/)

# Dasboard solution evaluation 
In this next section the developer experiences and evaluation criteria for selecting the dashboard solution will be described. 

## The Graph 
The first implementation attempt was started with The Graph, but later discontinued and replaced with Dune Analytics. 
 During the evaluation of the The Graph, the following challenges were experienced
